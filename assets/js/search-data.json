It currently uses text input to predict the score of a given review, but this can be changed by replacing &quot;Score&quot; references to any other column, such as the class names Cat1, Cat2 or Cat3. . 1. Installation . These libraries will need to be installed on the machine to be used later . pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas . Requirement already satisfied: scikit-learn in /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.10/site-packages (1.2.2) Requirement already satisfied: numpy in /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.10/site-packages (1.24.3) Requirement already satisfied: pandas in /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.10/site-packages (2.0.1) Requirement already satisfied: scipy&gt;=1.3.2 in /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from scikit-learn) (1.10.1) Requirement already satisfied: joblib&gt;=1.1.1 in /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from scikit-learn) (1.2.0) Requirement already satisfied: threadpoolctl&gt;=2.0.0 in /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from scikit-learn) (3.1.0) Requirement already satisfied: python-dateutil&gt;=2.8.2 in /Users/xiaoa1/Library/Python/3.10/lib/python/site-packages (from pandas) (2.8.2) Requirement already satisfied: pytz&gt;=2020.1 in /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from pandas) (2023.3) Requirement already satisfied: tzdata&gt;=2022.1 in /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from pandas) (2023.3) Requirement already satisfied: six&gt;=1.5 in /Users/xiaoa1/Library/Python/3.10/lib/python/site-packages (from python-dateutil&gt;=2.8.2-&gt;pandas) (1.16.0) Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages. . 2. Import Libraries . This notebook uses numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn for data analysis . import numpy as np import pandas as pd import re from sklearn.utils import shuffle from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.feature_selection import chi2, SelectKBest from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC . 3. Load and Preprocess Data . The dataset used is train_40k.csv from this Kaggle page. Loading the dataset into a pandas dataframe (df) allows for preprocessing by focusing on relevant columns (review text and rating) so that the data can be cleaned up by removing punctuation. . df_original = pd.read_csv(&#39;/Users/xiaoa1/VSCode/ds/_notebooks/data/train_40k.csv&#39;) columns = [&#39;Text&#39;, &#39;Score&#39;] df = shuffle(df_original[columns]) df.Score.value_counts() p = re.compile(r&#39;[^ w s]+&#39;) df[&#39;Text&#39;] = [p.sub(&#39;&#39;, x) for x in df[&#39;Text&#39;].tolist()] df.apply(lambda x: x.astype(str).str.lower()) .

Split the Dataset . scikit-learn has a feature to split data for training and testing. The test size and random state can be adjusted to increase accuracy. . x,y = df.Text, df.Score train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=4000) . 5. Building a Pipeline . Pipelines are an iterative way to build a model to accomodate variations in data and improve accuracy. Because datasets can be so large now, its beneficial for data to be sent through a pipeline so that it can be manipulated . pipeline = Pipeline([(&#39;vect&#39;, TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,2), stop_words=&#39;english&#39;, sublinear_tf=True)), (&#39;chi&#39;, SelectKBest(chi2, k=10000)), (&#39;clf&#39;, LinearSVC(C=1.0, penalty=&#39;l1&#39;,max_iter=3000, dual=False)) ]) . 6. Model Training . This fits the pipeline to our data . model = pipeline.fit(train_x, train_y) . 7. Model Evaluation . Using the score function to rate the accuracy of the model . print(&#39;accuracy score: &#39;+ str(model.score(test_x, test_y))) . accuracy score: 0.642625 . 8. Prediction . Now we can use the predict function to input our own written Amazon review and see what the predicted score is! . print(model.predict([&#39;price is good but tasted a bit stale&#39;])) # type your review here to see the predicted rating! exclude punctuation .

Use Pandas to clean the data. Most analysis, like Machine Learning or even Pandas in general like data to be in standardized format.

The result of &#39;Training&#39; data is making it easier to analyze or make conclusions. In looking at the Titanic, as you clean you would probably want to make assumptions on likely chance of survival. .

Machine Learning Visit Tutorials Point . Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts .
