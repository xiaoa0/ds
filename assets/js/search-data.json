You&#39;ll need scikit-learn, numpy, and pandas, which can be installed via pip: . pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas . Requirement already satisfied: scikit-learn in /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.10/site-packages (1.2.2) Requirement already satisfied: numpy in /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.10/site-packages (1.24.3) Requirement already satisfied: pandas in /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.10/site-packages (2.0.1) Requirement already satisfied: scipy&gt;=1.3.2 in /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from scikit-learn) (1.10.1) Requirement already satisfied: joblib&gt;=1.1.1 in /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from scikit-learn) (1.2.0) Requirement already satisfied: threadpoolctl&gt;=2.0.0 in /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from scikit-learn) (3.1.0) Requirement already satisfied: python-dateutil&gt;=2.8.2 in /Users/xiaoa1/Library/Python/3.10/lib/python/site-packages (from pandas) (2.8.2) Requirement already satisfied: pytz&gt;=2020.1 in /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from pandas) (2023.3) Requirement already satisfied: tzdata&gt;=2022.1 in /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from pandas) (2023.3) Requirement already satisfied: six&gt;=1.5 in /Users/xiaoa1/Library/Python/3.10/lib/python/site-packages (from python-dateutil&gt;=2.8.2-&gt;pandas) (1.16.0) Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages. . 2. Import Libraries . Import the required libraries in your Python script or Jupyter Notebook: . import numpy as np import pandas as pd import re from sklearn.utils import shuffle from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.feature_selection import chi2, SelectKBest from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfTransformer from sklearn import svm from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score . 3. Load and Preprocess Data . Load your labeled dataset into a pandas DataFrame. Preprocess the text data by cleaning and preparing it for analysis, including steps like removing punctuation, stopwords, and performing tokenization. Ensure that your DataFrame has two columns: &quot;text&quot; (containing the text data) and &quot;label&quot; (containing the corresponding labels). . df_original = pd.read_csv(&#39;/Users/xiaoa1/VSCode/ds/_notebooks/data/train_40k.csv&#39;) df_val = pd.read_csv(&#39;/Users/xiaoa1/VSCode/ds/_notebooks/data/val_10k.csv&#39;) columns = [&#39;Text&#39;, &#39;Cat1&#39;, &#39;Cat2&#39;] df = shuffle(df_original[columns]) df.Cat1.value_counts() df.Cat2.value_counts() p = re.compile(r&#39;[^ w s]+&#39;) df[&#39;Text&#39;] = [p.sub(&#39;&#39;, x) for x in df[&#39;Text&#39;].tolist()] df.apply(lambda x: x.astype(str).str.lower()) .

Split the Dataset . Split your dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn. This ensures that you have data for training the model as well as evaluating its performance: . x,y,z = df.Text, df.Cat1, df.Cat2 train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y, train_z, test_z = train_test_split(x, y, z, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) . 5. Feature Extraction . Convert the text data into numerical feature vectors that can be used by machine learning algorithms. Use scikit-learn&#39;s CountVectorizer to convert text into a matrix of token counts: . pipeline = Pipeline([(&#39;vect&#39;, TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,2), stop_words=&#39;english&#39;, sublinear_tf=True)), (&#39;chi&#39;, SelectKBest(chi2, k=10000)), (&#39;clf&#39;, LinearSVC(C=1.0, penalty=&#39;l1&#39;,max_iter=3000, dual=False)) ]) . 6. Model Training . Choose a classification algorithm, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), and train the model using the training data: . model = pipeline.fit(train_x, train_y, train_z) . TypeError Traceback (most recent call last) /Users/xiaoa1/VSCode/ds/_notebooks/2023-05-23-NLP.ipynb Cell 14 in 1 -&gt; &lt;a href=&#39;vscode-notebook-cell:/Users/xiaoa1/VSCode/ds/_notebooks/2023-05-23-NLP.ipynb#X16sZmlsZQ%3D%3D?line=0&#39;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; model = pipeline.fit(train_x, train_y, train_z) TypeError: Pipeline.fit() takes from 2 to 3 positional arguments but 4 were given . 7. Model Evaluation . Use the trained model to predict the labels for the test data, and evaluate its performance using accuracy or other suitable metrics: . print(&#39;accuracy score: &#39;+ str(model.score(test_x, test_y, test_z))) . accuracy score: 0.843375 . 8. Prediction . Once your model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to classify new, unseen text data by transforming the text into feature vectors using the CountVectorizer and then applying the trained model&#39;s predict method. . print(model.predict([&#39;bright color and good texture&#39;])) . [&#39;beauty&#39;] .",

The result of &#39;Training&#39; data is making it easier to analyze or make conclusions. In looking at the Titanic, as you clean you would probably want to make assumptions on likely chance of survival. . This would involve analyzing various factors (such as age, gender, class, etc.) that may have affected a person&#39;s chances of survival, and using that information to make predictions about whether an individual would have survived or not. .

Machine Learning Visit Tutorials Point . Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts .
